## Prediction problem
I aim to predict whether a person will experience a heart attack or heart disease at some point in their life from their health-related risk behaviours and chronic health conditions (if any). This is a classification prediction problem because the output variables are discrete and binary â€“ respondents either have never or have had a heart attack/disease.

I explored NBA data for my previous final project; for this one I was hoping to explore a new field, preferably one from real data and that I can have useful takeaways from. After what felt like days of searching for a suitable dataset that fit the criteria, I found this dataset on heart disease health indicators. My parents are in their 60s, and they need to go for health checkups quite regularly. Thankfully nothing too serious has happened to them yet, but I thought it'd be really interesting if I could use the model that I make to see if their health habits make them more likely to experience any heart conditions (hopefully not!!!), and if so help them change their habits in the right direction. 


## Data source

I sourced my dataset, the Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset, from Kaggle.^[Teboul, A (2023). Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset. Kaggle. Retrieved February 4, 2022, from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/heart-disease-health-indicators-dataset/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/heart-disease-health-indicators-dataset/data)] This dataset itself is based off the 2015 edition of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a health-related telephone survey administered to over 400,000 Americans from all 50 states (plus D.C. and 3 U.S. territories), making it the largest ongoing health survey system globally. It has provided invaluable data on health risk factors and trends across the country.^[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2024, November 22). Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Cdc.gov. [https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html)]

The dataset I am currently using is a cleaned and consolidated version of the original BRFSS 2015 dataset^[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2017). Behavioral Risk Surveillance System. Kaggle. Retrieved February 4, 2022 from ([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system)]. The creator of the Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset selected features in the BRFSS that reflected risk factors of heart disease, dropped missing values, modified and cleaned values, and made the feature names more readable. Therefore, very little tidying will be necessary.



## Data quality check

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Overall dataset

```{r}
#| label: tbl-data-quality-check
#| tbl-cap: 'Quality check of the dataset'
#| echo: false

# creating summary 
summary_table <- hdhi_training |>
  summarise(
    `Total Observations` = nrow(hdhi_training),
    `Total Variables` = ncol(hdhi_training),
    `Categorical Variables` = sum(sapply(hdhi_training, is.factor)),
    `Numerical Variables` = sum(sapply(hdhi_training, is.numeric)),
    `Missing Values` = sum(is.na(hdhi_training))
  )

# creating table
knitr::kable(summary_table)
```


#### Individual Variables

```{r}
#| label: tbl-variables-quality-check
#| tbl-cap: 'Quality check of individual variables of the dataset'
#| echo: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: 'Individual variables'

hdhi_training |>
  skim() |>
  select(skim_type:factor.top_counts) |>
  datatable(
    rownames = FALSE
  ) 
```


::: 

According to @tbl-data-quality-check, there are 202,944 observations and 22 variables. Of these variables, 15 are categorical and 7 are numerical. There is also no missingness in this dataset. @tbl-variables-quality-check displays individual summaries for each variable. Tidying is likely not necessary for this dataset because as aforementioned, this dataset has already been cleaned and consolidated from the original BRFSS 2015 dataset. 



## Target variable analysis

![Number of Americans who have had heart disease or a heart attack](../figures/hdhi_barchart.png){#fig-hdhi_barchart}

```{r}
#| label: tbl-hdhi_outcome
#| tbl-cap: 'Incidence of Heart Disease/Attack among American respondents'
#| echo: false

hdhi_outcome_table <- hdhi_training |>
  mutate(`Reported Previous Heart Disease/Attack?` = `HeartDiseaseorAttack`) |>
  count(`Reported Previous Heart Disease/Attack?`) |>
  mutate(`Proportion` = (100 * n / sum(n)) |> round(digits = 1)) 
  
knitr::kable(hdhi_outcome_table)

```

Given that our outcome variable is a factor variable (respondents have either had heart disease or a heart attack before, or they have not), the univariate analysis of the target variable is limited to counts rather than distribution or skewness. We can see from @fig-hdhi_barchart that the number of Americans who have had heart disease/attack are much higher than those who have in our training dataset. The exact numbers and proportions are reported in @tbl-hdhi_outcome, with 90.6% of respondents reporting they have never had heart disease/attack versus 9.4% who have. This is not necessarily surprising given that 5.5% of American adults reported they had been diagnosed with heart disease in 2018^[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2024, August 5). Heart Disease Prevalence . CDC National Center for Health Statistics. [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/topics/heart-disease-prevalence.htm.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/topics/heart-disease-prevalence.htm#:~:text=The%20age%2Dadjusted%20prevalence%20of%20heart%20disease%20in%20men%20decreased,women%20reported%20having%20heart%20disease.)] (This is an age-adjusted estimate that eliminates differences that arise from age, which accounts for the somewhat significant difference between 5.5% and 9.4%). We also likely do not need to do any transformations of the outcome variable. 

## Misc
Proposed timeline (by this date I will have....): 

- 26 Feb: Tried at least three different classification algorithms (decision tree, binary classification, random forests) to see which model is most accurate for this dataset.  Will use the F1 score as the metric to evaluate model accuracy. 
- 5 Mar: Tried three other classification algorithms.
- 12 Mar: Submitted!
